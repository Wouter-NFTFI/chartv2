# Chart V2 Coding Standards

## General Rules
- All new files should include the standard header comments
- API calls should use verified contract ABIs
- No fallbacks, mock data, or normalized fields should be used

## NFT Data
- Floor prices should be fetched directly from blockchain or trusted API sources
- Always use verified contract ABIs
- Data should be displayed in raw form without normalization

## CORS
- All API endpoints must have proper CORS headers
- External API calls should include proper Content-Type headers
## ‚ùå Prohibited Practices
### 1. No Mock Data
- Never use mock data or placeholders for any on-chain value.
- No fake `price`, `tokenId`, `owner`, or `contractAddress` values.
- All data must come from real RPC queries, verified indexers, or decoded logs.
## Components
- Components should be stateless when possible
- Complex data fetching should be separated from rendering components
- Error states must be handled explicitly

### 2. No Fallbacks or Silent Defaults
- Avoid fallback patterns like `||`, `??`, or `value || default`.
- If data is missing or invalid, throw a clear error and log context.
- Do not auto-substitute fallback prices, owners, or empty arrays.

### 3. No Normalization or Aliasing
- Do not rename or reformat data fields from smart contracts.
- Maintain the raw structure and field names as defined in the ABI.

### 4. No Ambiguous Field Sources
- A field must have **only one** canonical source.
- Never do: `price = item.price || item.value || item.cost`.

## ‚úÖ Required Practices

### 1. Use Real ABIs and Types
- Always use contract ABIs via `TypeChain`, `viem`, or verified sources.
- Define clear TypeScript types or Zod schemas to validate on-chain data.

### 2. Immutability First
- Treat all blockchain data as historical and immutable.
- Never mutate on-chain-derived data ‚Äî only extend it via metadata fields if necessary.

### 3. Error-First Design
- Prefer throwing errors over silently degrading.
- Bubble errors up visibly ‚Äî do not catch and suppress errors related to on-chain data.

### 4. No Centralized Secrets in Source Code
- Store any API keys, RPC URLs, or access tokens in environment variables.
- Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files ‚Äî include them in `.gitignore`.

### 5. Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Extract common logic into reusable functions or hooks.
- Avoid copy-pasting similar fetchers or parsing logic.

## üß† Context for Cursor

This is a **blockchain-integrated app**, not a standard web app. Cursor must prioritize:
- Immutability
- Trustlessness
- Canonical data sources
- Zero ambiguity or inference

Avoid "helper" practices common in Web2, like silent defaults, UX smoothing, or data smoothing. This is a source-of-truth interface for blockchain state, not a marketing site.
